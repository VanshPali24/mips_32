## Overview

This project implements a fully functional 32-bit MIPS processor modelled on the classic Patterson & Hennessy architecture. The processor executes instructions in a 5-stage pipeline and handles all common pipeline hazards:

| Feature | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Architecture | 32-bit MIPS |
| Pipeline Depth | 5 stages |
| Data Hazard Mitigation | Full forwarding (EX-EX and MEM-EX paths) |
| Load-Use Hazard | Hazard Detection Unit + pipeline stall |
| Control Hazard | Branch Not Taken + single-cycle flush on misprediction |

Control signals, register values, and intermediate results are carried through dedicated **pipeline registers** (IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB) between every stage.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Instruction Fetch (IF)
- Fetches the 32-bit instruction from instruction memory at the current Program Counter (PC).
- Increments PC by 4 (PC + 4) for sequential execution.
- On a stall, holds the PC and the IF/ID register; on a branch flush, inserts a NOP (bubble).

### 2. Instruction Decode / Register Fetch (ID)
- Decodes the fetched instruction and reads the two source registers (`rs`, `rt`) from the 32-entry register file.
- Generates all control signals for downstream stages.
- Performs sign-extension of the 16-bit immediate field to 32 bits.
- The Hazard Detection Unit monitors this stage to insert stalls when a load-use dependency is detected.

### 3. Execute (EX)
- The ALU performs the operation specified by the control signals (arithmetic, logical, shift, comparison).
- Selects ALU operands from the register file outputs or the Forwarding Unit's MUX outputs.
- Computes the effective memory address for load/store instructions (`base + offset`).
- The Forwarding Unit is entirely combinational logic living in this stage.

### 4. Memory Access (MEM)
- Reads from or writes to data memory for `lw` / `sw` instructions.
- All non-memory instructions pass through this stage unchanged.
- The branch resolution also completes here — if a taken branch is detected, the incorrectly fetched instruction in IF is flushed.

### 5. Write Back (WB)
- Writes the result (ALU output or memory read data) back to the destination register in the register file.
- The write happens in the first half of the clock cycle; the register read in ID happens in the second half, enabling same-cycle forwarding for certain cases.

## Hazard Handling

### Data Hazards — Forwarding Unit

The Forwarding Unit eliminates most data hazards without stalling by detecting when a later pipeline stage holds a result that an earlier instruction in EX currently needs.

**EX-EX Forwarding** — forwards the ALU result from EX/MEM directly to the EX stage ALU input:

```
Condition:  EX/MEM.RegWrite
        AND EX/MEM.RegisterRd ≠ 0
        AND EX/MEM.RegisterRd = ID/EX.RegisterRs (or Rt)
```

**MEM-EX Forwarding** — forwards the result from MEM/WB (either ALU result or memory data) to the EX stage ALU input:

```
Condition:  MEM/WB.RegWrite
        AND MEM/WB.RegisterRd ≠ 0
        AND MEM/WB.RegisterRd = ID/EX.RegisterRs (or Rt)
        AND (EX-EX forwarding condition is NOT satisfied)
```

Two 3-to-1 MUXes (`ForwardA`, `ForwardB`) in the EX stage select the correct operand:

| MUX Select | Source |
|---|---|
| `00` | Register file output (no forwarding) |
| `10` | EX/MEM pipeline register (EX-EX) |
| `01` | MEM/WB pipeline register (MEM-EX) |

---

### Load-Use Hazard — Stall / Hazard Detection Unit

A `lw` instruction cannot forward its result until after the MEM stage, one cycle later than an ALU instruction. When the instruction immediately following a `lw` needs the loaded value, a **one-cycle stall (bubble)** is inserted.

**Detection logic:**

```
Stall if:  ID/EX.MemRead = 1
       AND (ID/EX.RegisterRt = IF/ID.RegisterRs
            OR ID/EX.RegisterRt = IF/ID.RegisterRt)
```

**On a stall:**
- PC is held (not incremented).
- IF/ID pipeline register is held (instruction is re-fetched next cycle).
- ID/EX pipeline register is zeroed (NOP bubble inserted into EX stage).

**Example:**
```mips
lw   $t9, 88($t0)    # MEM stage reads data
add  $t17, $t7, $t9  # needs $t9 → stall inserted here
```

---

### Control Hazards — Branch Not Taken

The processor uses a **branch-not-taken** static prediction strategy:

1. The processor always fetches the instruction at PC + 4 (the fall-through path) after a branch.
2. Branch outcome and target address are resolved in the **MEM stage**.
3. If the branch is **not taken** — no action needed; the fetched instruction is correct.
4. If the branch **is taken** — the one incorrectly fetched instruction (now in IF/ID) is **flushed** by zeroing the IF/ID register (inserting a NOP/bubble), and the PC is updated to the branch target.

**Penalty:** at most **1 cycle** per taken branch.

```
Cycle:   1      2      3      4      5
BEQ:    [IF]  [ID]   [EX]  [MEM]  [WB]
PC+4:         [IF]   [ID]  [EX]* ← flushed if branch taken
Target:               ---   [IF]   [ID]  ...
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Quartus Prime Altera (Lite Version)
- ModelSim (for simulation)

### Loading a Custom Program

- Make a .hex file containing one instruction per line, in the corresponding 32 bit format of instructions

## Simulation & Testing

The testbench suite covers the following scenarios:

| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| Sequential execution | Basic R-type and I-type instruction flow |
| EX-EX forwarding | Back-to-back ALU instructions with shared registers |
| MEM-EX forwarding | ALU instruction two cycles after a producer |
| Load-use stall | `lw` immediately followed by a dependent instruction |
| Branch not taken | Branch evaluates false; fall-through is correct |
| Branch taken + flush | Branch evaluates true; incorrectly fetched instruction is squashed |
| Combined hazards | Interleaved loads, branches, and ALU ops |

- All the 32 registers in Register File are initialized as follows:
```mips
integer i;
initial begin
	for (i = 0; i < 32; i = i + 1) begin
		Reg[i] = i;
	end
end
```
Three test cases are already added for testing which covers various functionalities. Below are the instruction sets:
  
**instr_hazard1:**
```mips
add  $t2, $t3, $t5    
sub  $t1, $t2, $t4
or   $t29, $t2, $t8
and  $t30, $t6, $t29
add  $t20, $t9, $t29
add  $t20, $t20, $t19
add  $t20, $t20, $t18
add  $t20, $t20, $t17
```
**instr_hazard2:**
```mips
sw  $t5, 80($t8)
add $t6, $t3, $t2
sub $t7, $t6, $t1
lw $t9, 88($t0)
add $t17, $t7, $t9    
```

**instr_hazard3:**
```mips
beq $t1, $t1, 2
sub $t5, $t7, $t6
add $t2, $t3, $t4
slt $t8, $t10, $t9
or $t12, $t13, $t14
```

Run individual testbenches:
- Pre-made test testbenches corresponding to the test cases described above are present in the test folder, named as testPipe1, testPipe2 and testPipe3. These contain general reset stimuli and monitor functions to observe textual results in the terminal while simulation. Users may modify the displayed items by providing proper path of the component to be  monitored.
- From the Settings -> Simulation option in Quartus, select the created/ pre built test benches from the drop down menu and Apply.
- Also make sure to change the name/path of the corresponding .hex file in the InstrMem.v file, in the $readmemh command.

## Design Decisions

**Branch resolved in MEM vs EX** — Resolving the branch in MEM keeps the datapath simple and avoids special-case forwarding into the branch comparator. The cost is a maximum of one flush cycle per taken branch, which is acceptable for this implementation.

**Register file write-then-read** — The register file supports writing in the first half of the clock cycle and reading in the second half, eliminating the WB→ID data hazard without a forwarding path.

**No delayed branching** — The MIPS ISA historically used a branch delay slot. This implementation does not use a delay slot; the branch-not-taken strategy with flush is used instead for simplicity and clarity.

**Structural hazards** — Separate instruction and data memories (Harvard architecture) are used to avoid structural hazards in the IF and MEM stages.
